        <p>
          &#9827; His works helped popularize the romanized script of the
          Vietnamese language, Quốc Ngữ, leading to its officialization in the
          early 20th century.<br /><br />
          &#9827; He served in the French colonial regime as a linguist, and
          also translated many literary works into modern Vietnamese.<br /><br />
          At 12, Ky studied the Christian Bible with Father Hue (or the Priest
          Belleveaux) and followed him to the Pinhalu School in Phnom Penh,
          Cambodia.<br /><br />
          &#9827; In 1851, Truong was granted a scholarship by this school to
          study at the Penang Seminary, then the main centre of Roman Catholic
          training for Southeast Asian countries.<br /><br />
          &#9827; Truong Vinh Ky worked mainly in the cultural domain, but he
          also worked for 8 months at the Viện cơ mật (Secret Affairs Institute,
          Privy Council) in the court at Huế and another 8 months as an
          interpreter in the Vietnamese delegation to France.<br /><br />
          &#9827; In June, 1863, he accompanied Phan Thanh Gian, the chief
          delegator sent to France by the Hue Court to negotiate the retrieval
          of provinces lost into French hands. This trip was a good opportunity
          for Truong to meet with famous figures at the time such as Victor
          Hugo, Littre, Renan, and French statesmen.<br /><br />
          &#9827; He was professor of French language at the Interpreter School
          (1866-1868), Chief editor for the Gia Dinh News (1868), Director of
          the Pedagogic School and at the same time Secretary of the City
          Council of Cho Lon (1872), professor in French language for the French
          and Spanish expats at the Collège des Administrateurs Stagiaires in
          1874.<br /><br />
          &#9827; During his 40 years working in the cultural field, Truong Vinh
          Ky created 118 works of many genres such as research, collecting,
          translation, transcription, tens of which were written in French.<br /><br />
          &#9827; In the time of transition and cultural intersection between
          West and East in Vietnam at the end of 19th and early 20th century,
          Truong had such a grandiose career that the French scholar J. Bouchot
          called him "the only scholar in Indochina and even the modern
          China."<br /><br />
